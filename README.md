## About
Ibralogue is a simple and extendable dialogue system library for Unity. Dialogue is written in `.ibra` files which have their own syntax which you can
learn more about in the [wiki](https://github.com/ibra/Ibralogue/wiki).
## Installation
Ibralogue is _currently_ only available as a unity package, and you can grab the latest one from the [releases page](https://github.com/ibra/Ibralogue/releases).
## Features
Ibralogue is extremely early in development so it is missing a few features, though it is built with user extendability in mind. Heres a table of features that have been either implemented or have been planned.
