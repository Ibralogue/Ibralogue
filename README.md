> :warning: **Ibralogue is still in pre-release**: This means it is not production-ready yet. Feel free to toy around with it but it is subject to rapid changes due to how early it is into development!

## About

Ibralogue is a simple and extendable dialogue system library for Unity. Dialogue is written in `.ibra` files which have their own syntax which you can
learn more about in the [wiki](https://github.com/ibra/Ibralogue/wiki).

## Installation

Ibralogue is available as a unity package, and you can grab the latest one from the [releases page](https://github.com/ibra/Ibralogue/releases).

You can also install it with OpenUPM:

```
$ openupm add com.ibra.ibralogue
```
