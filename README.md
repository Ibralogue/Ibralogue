> :warning: **Ibralogue is still in pre-release**: This means it is not production-ready yet. Feel free to toy around with it but it is subject to rapid changes due to how early it is into development!

## About

Ibralogue is a simple and extendable dialogue system library for Unity. Dialogue is written in `.ibra` files which have their own syntax which you can
learn more about in the [docs](https://ibralogue.github.io/Ibralogue/manual/syntax-guide.html). For help regarding Ibralogue you can join the [support server](https://discord.gg/cGhVJmukTvs).

## Features

Although still early in development, Ibralogue has quite a few features, including but not limited to:

- a rich, easy-to-grasp syntax
- branching dialogue with choices
- using variables in dialogue
- invoking static functions from dialogue files
- line-by-line character portraits

In it's current state Ibralogue is still very usable, even if not production-ready, and if you'd like to report a bug or request a new feature, be sure to [open an issue](https://github.com/Ibralogue/Ibralogue/issues/new/choose)!

## Installation

Ibralogue is available as a unity package, and you can install it via the Unity Package Manager.
