## Basic Syntax
Use square brackets to define speaker names. Anything below that is part of the same sentence until the next
speaker name is reached, for example:

```text
[NPC]
Hi!
How are you?
```

To move a sentence to the next `Dialogue`, just use the same speaker name again.

```text
[NPC] 
Hi!
[NPC]
How are you?
```
